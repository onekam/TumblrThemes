# Welcome to Moe's Themes
I began making Tumblr Themes in mid 2015 as a way of teaching myself HTML and CSS. Ever since, it has been a fun hobby of mine, and after over a year (perfectionists, I tell you - we're the worst), I'm finally putting them out there for people to use.

# Terms of Use
I'm pretty relaxed about the usage of my themes. As long as you don't claim them as your own, you can do what you want. Feel free to edit them to your heart's content, use them on whatever kind of blog you want, utilize them as base code, etc. My only stipulation is that, if you do use my themes/parts of my themes in your own, you credit me, either at my Tumblr (moethemes.tumblr.com) or here on my GitHub.

Hope you enjoy! If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, feel free to contact me here or message me on Tumblr.
